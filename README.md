# The Mission X Brief

is enormous, but we need to pick our sections to help us organise and create a scaffold around. Here's some things to remember:

## A. General stuff

### 1. Don't worry about the CSS.

A lot of the CSS we'll need is already outlined in the Adobe XD document:

To have a look for yourself:

1. click any element on each slide
2. hit the </> button on the right edge sidebar
3. behold the pre-done CSS

### 2. Pick a colour, and focus only on the stuff in that colour.

Don't get caught up in the size of the project or the bits and pieces that you can't 'see'. Either it's _nobody's section_ (which we'll account for in the end presentation, and are uncoloured bits in the miro board), or it's _somebody else's section_.

## Here's some key take-aways for each colour, might help you decide which to raise your hand for:

### 1. Orange - Home, log-in/Sign-up

1. Home page is a static webpage - won't change much. Heaps of buttons that change what's displayed on a sizable chunk of the page&mdash;

<img src="/assets/images/main-buttons.png">

&mdash;and some RWD work to be done:

<img src="/assets/images/main-page-icons.png>

These icons need to go from horizontal on desk devices to vertical on mobile.

2. Log-in/Sign-up is neat

So yeah, click this link:

and click the magenta (pink? rose? idk) 'Sign Up' button. Container that renders over the main page, blurs everything else, and changes content depending on if you click 'LOG IN' or 'SIGN UP', either in the student or teacher section. Very spiffy.
